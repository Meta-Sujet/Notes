```dart
//Dart doesn’t let you access instance methods during initialization.
class User {
  User(this.name); 

 final String name;
 final int _secretNumber = _calculateSecret(); 

 int _calculateSecret() { 

 return name.length + 42;
  } 

}

 
//Using late means that Dart doesn’t initialize the variable right away. It only initializes it when you access it the first time. This is also known as lazy initialization. It’s like procrastination for variables.

late final int _secretNumber = _calculateSecret(); 


//It’s also common to use late to initialize a field variable in the constructor body.
//Initializing a final variable in the constructor body wouldn’t have been allowed if it weren’t marked as late.

class User {
  User(this.name) { 
	 _secretNumber = _calculateSecret();
  } 

 late final int _secretNumber; 
//.....

//you can also use late with non-final variables.

class User {
 late String name;
}

 
final user = User(); print(user.name);

//using late means that you’re promising Dart that you’ll initialize the field before it’s ever used. This moves checking from compile-time to runtime.


//Benefits of being lazy:

//There are times when it might take some heavy calculations to initialize a variable. If you never end up using the variable, then all that initialization work was a waste. Since lazy initialization is never done until you actually use the variable, though, this kind of work will never be wasted.

//Top-level and static variables have always been lazy in Dart. As you learned above, the late keyword makes other variables lazy, too. That means even if your variable is nullable, you can still use late to get the benefit of making it lazy.

class SomeClass {
 late String? value = doHeavyCalculation();
 String? doHeavyCalculation() { 
 // do heavy calculation 
} }

//The method doHeavyCalculation is only run after you access value the first time. And if you never access it, you never do the work.
